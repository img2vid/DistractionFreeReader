This is a PDF Reader for distracted students and unfocused readers.
After opening the program, choose a PDF file and enter the amount of time you want to read it for.
Once the PDF file is selected and the timer is set, a countdown will begin. The PDF cannot be closed in any way before the countdown expires. 
The program may restart if the PC is rebooted.
The program can only be terminated by pressing Alt+F4 keys together, when no active timer is counting down.

This will help you increase your reading time on your computer and help avoid distractions.
